                <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-lg-10 col-xl-8">
                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 lh-sm no-text-indent add-semi-colon-to-end">Who they are</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Consult Construct are building surveyors based in Kent. They
                            give expert advice on surveying, project management, energy efficiency, and design for
                            homeowners, commercial businesses, the public sector and private contractors.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold my-4 no-text-indent add-semi-colon-to-end">Challenges they were having</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Like a lot of companies, they were using an old-school document
                            management system that meant employees had to dig through a labyrinth of Windows Server
                            Folders to find the files they needed.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Wading through folder after folder left the team frustrated, and
                            the files they did find were often outdated versions. This meant templates were being used
                            inconsistently across the business, having a knock-on effect on their clients.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">They used Trello as their project management tool, but the way
                            they used it came with its own challenges. The system they had in place made it difficult
                            for the team to update it as consistently as they wanted to, it was hard for management to
                            stay on top of projects, and tracking and reminding people of deadlines was difficult too.
                        </p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 no-text-indent lh-sm add-semi-colon-to-end">What we did to help</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">To get a better understanding of the issues they were having
                            with the current system, we ran workshops with staff and senior management.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We then created a plan to put new technology and processes in
                            place to help operations run smoother.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This involved researching and comparing various platforms,
                            including SharePoint, which we found to be too expensive and inefficient.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">In the end, we went for a flexible no-code platform that could
                            be customised to their needs. This new platform was easy for staff to use, required little
                            training to get them off and running, and meant they could customise the system themselves
                            without needing us.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 no-text-indent lh-sm add-semi-colon-to-end">How we did it</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We built an intranet and workflow management system using a
                            no-code platform to replace Trello and the old Windows Server Folders. This was a
                            self-managed system that was easy to use and required little training.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">When we rolled out this new system, we first migrated all the
                            data from their shared files and Trello. Then we held sessions with the team to make sure
                            they could use the new no-code system easily, customise it to their needs, and manage their
                            workflows more efficiently.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We also offered our ongoing support to Consult Construct should
                            they have any issues or staff need extra help adapting to the new system during the
                            transition.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 no-text-indent lh-sm add-semi-colon-to-end">Impact</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">After we built and helped the company implement the new
                            easy-to-use system, they have enjoyed significant improvements in document consistency and
                            efficiency.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Employees now pull templates from the central intranet - fast.
                            This guarantees the consistency of documents and reports sent to their clients.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">New admin personnel can use the new system after just five
                            minutes of training.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">No more headaches. No more lost documents. No more wasted time.
                            No more inconsistencies.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Instead, they have a smooth workflow and better document
                            management - making it faster and easier than ever to continue providing a great service to
                            their clients.</p>
