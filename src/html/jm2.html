            <div class="container">
                <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-lg-10 col-xl-8">
                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">Who they are:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">JM2 Group is a ground maintenance company that provides a
                            variety of cleaning and landscaping maintenance services to many of the UK's Block
                            Management companies.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">Problems they were having:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">By changing its business model and expanding its subcontracting
                            to cover a wider range of services, JM2 Group wanted to become an all-encompassing service
                            provider. But this shift in direction brought three distinct challenges.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">1 - Higher volumes of communication:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Managing their inbox was like a full-time job that involved
                            sending out hundreds of emails every day to hundreds of subcontractors, requesting quotes,
                            coordinating jobs and handling all the job completion information. This was too much for an
                            entire team to handle, never mind one person.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">2 - Inefficient subcontractor search:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Their process of searching for and finding the right
                            subcontractors nationwide for specific jobs lacked efficiency. For example, if they needed
                            to track down five roofing companies with a rope access certification in southeast London,
                            they would have to send a quote to each of them manually which proved to be incredibly
                            time-consuming.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">3 - Tracking the performance of subcontractors:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">They lacked an effective system for tracking which
                            subcontractors they've used, when they used them, their performance, and their
                            qualifications.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">What we did:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">The main task was to simplify JM2's operations by building a
                            supplier database.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This made it easier for them to manage subcontractors and grow
                            their business without having more admin work.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">How we did it:</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">Building a supplier database</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This new, easy-to-use database lets JM2 Group upload all their
                            subcontractors' details - such as their certifications, services, and areas they cover. We
                            also added a ratings system to track how well each subcontractor performs.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">Automating communication</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">To cut down on their endless email exchanges, we set up a new
                            system that automatically sends out SMS and email notifications to relevant subcontractors
                            about new jobs.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This lets them check job details and upload quotes via a link
                            without having to log in. All quotes and job responses within the system are then in one
                            place, meaning no overcrowded inboxes.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">Improving efficiency</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We made it easier and faster for JM2 Group to search for
                            subcontractors based on qualifications and location, speeding up the process of assigning
                            jobs.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This lets JM2 Group manage more jobs without the need to hire
                            more administrative staff.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">Impact:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">The new system brought significant improvements to JM2 Group's
                            operations, helping them scale from 10 jobs a day to 100 jobs a day without needing to hire
                            extra administrative staff.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">The quoting and job management process became much smoother,
                            allowing them to handle the increased workload without incurring any extra costs.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This set the stage for future growth and expansion.</p>
