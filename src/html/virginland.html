                    <div class="col-lg-10 col-xl-8">
                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 lh-sm no-text-indent">Who they are:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Virgin Land helps developers source land they're looking to
                            purchase that meets their specific requirements. They do this by automating outreach to
                            landowners, asking if they're looking to sell.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This combination of technology, data analysis and expert
                            guidance ultimately makes the process of land acquisition and development simpler and
                            slicker.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 lh-sm no-text-indent">Challenges they were having:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">When we started working with Virgin Land, they were in their
                            infancy. They thought they needed a custom-built system, but they didn't at that stage of
                            their business.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">They were relying on slow, manual processes to find land and
                            match it with buyers, which was proving incredibly time-consuming.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">They had lots of brilliant ideas about how to use tech to solve
                            this, but we needed to help them work within the resources and budget they had at the time -
                            without wasting any money.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 lh-sm no-text-indent">What we did:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We put together a phased plan that was primarily based on their
                            current needs, but would also set them up for future growth.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Keeping things low-cost was key, so we gave them a no-code,
                            cost-effective and efficient system to start off with (rather than bespoke software).</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Then, as they began to grow, we helped them upgrade to a custom
                            system. We still support them now on an ongoing basis with tech and strategy advice as they
                            continue to grow.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 lh-sm no-text-indent">How we did it:</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold my-4 no-text-indent">Phase One: Making automation quick and easy.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">After some research, we used Google Sheets and Pipedrive with
                            Zapier to automate the matching and letter-sending process.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Using these off-the-shelf tools meant we avoided having to build
                            expensive software, while still giving Virgin Land the functionality they needed. These
                            tools gave the team the ability to create their own automations - allowing them to test,
                            refine, and optimise their approach as they developed their business model.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold my-4 no-text-indent">Phase Two: Building a custom system.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">With more money coming in after securing angel investment,
                            Virgin Land started to experience growth and eventually outgrew the original system we put
                            in place.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We helped them move to a new, custom-built system, migrating
                            their data and operations during the transition.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We also acted as their outsourced CTO (Chief Technology Officer)
                            to guide them on tech strategy, product development and building relationships with
                            investors.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">This helped them shape their tech vision and build an MVP, as
                            well as giving them the tools to handle the challenges of growing the business.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold my-4 no-text-indent">Phase 3: Looking ahead</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We're currently helping Virgin Land secure Series A funding that
                            would allow them to scale their business and expand their current system.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">The plan going forward is to apply machine learning to make the
                            process of finding and matching land with landowners even smarter.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold my-4 lh-sm no-text-indent">Impact:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">On a surface level, our phased approach saved Virgin Land
                            valuable time and money. But the key here is that we provided the ability for the team to
                            change their technology as their business evolved. They are agile - using their flexibility
                            to respond quickly to discoveries they made as they developed.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Eventually, this approach helped Virgin Land secure angel
                            investment and be acquired by The Ringley Group - further boosting their growth.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">They're now preparing for Series A funding and, with our ongoing
                            support, they're ready to innovate even further with the addition of machine learning -
                            continuing to reshape and revolutionise land acquisition for developers.</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We continue to act as Virgin Land's dedicated technology partner
                            as they continue their growth as one of the most exciting startups in the land acquisition
                            space.</p>
