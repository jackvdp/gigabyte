                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">Who they are:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Frankham Group provides a comprehensive range of building
                            services covering design, engineering and consultancy services. With several subsidiaries,
                            like Frankham RMS (Risk Management Services), they provide everything from building surveys
                            to engineering consultancy.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">Challenges they were having:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">When Frankham Group decided to make the switch to a new CRM
                            system, they realised their data organisation could be improved. They were using a mix of
                            spreadsheets, legacy systems, and other ad-hoc tools to store information and keep track of
                            existing clients and future prospects. But this led to missed opportunities with potential,
                            existing, and historic clients.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">What we did:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Like a lot of businesses, Frankham Group's senior management
                            team were excited about AI and the benefits it could bring to their organisation. But a lot
                            of the information and stories in the press you read about AI don't really give you tips
                            about the practical application of it. If anything, what you read doesn't touch the surface
                            of what's possible.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We started with an interactive workshop to see what <em>was</em>
                            possible and spot opportunities, together. This is when Frankham Group realised they were
                            sitting on a potential goldmine. They had valuable contact information of potential
                            customers in their email system that, should they have a way of extracting it, could fill
                            their pipeline with over £1 million worth of potential customers - immediately.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">After this realisation, we used AI to extract this data and
                            enrich it with information that would make the data set even more valuable to the business.
                        </p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">How we did it:</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">Extracting contacts using AI</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We used AI algorithms to pull contact details straight from
                            email signatures in their system and gathered detailed statistics on each contact. This
                            included figuring out who each contact belonged to, how often they were in touch, and what
                            their interactions were about. From that, we made sure no contact information was lost.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">Data Enrichment:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">Once we'd pulled all the contact information, we took it and
                            added extra details from Linkedin and other sources to provide more context about each
                            person (information like their current job, professional background, and potential business
                            opportunities). Armed with this enriched data, Franken Group could then make better, more
                            informed decisions and customise their communication strategies moving forward.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">CRM Integration:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">For this, we worked with Deltek (their new CRM provider) to
                            automate data updates. We set the system up to run nightly updates that would populate the
                            CRM with the latest contact information. Safeguarding this was also a top priority, so we
                            created rules and flags to highlight important contacts for the business development team,
                            plugging those leaks in the system. This way, it would make sure they wouldn't miss any
                            opportunities.</p>

                        <p class="fs-lg fw-bold mb-2">Automated Alerts:</p>
                        <p class="fs-lg text-secondary">We also set up alerts when a contact changed companies. This
                            would act as a reminder for the team to reach out and congratulate them on their new role.
                            More importantly, it would invite them to explore new business opportunities. With this new
                            proactive approach, we helped Franken Group stay connected with their contacts and leverage
                            their existing relationships to win new business.</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-4 lh-sm">Impact:</p>
                        <ul class="fs-lg text-secondary">
                            <li>Extracted over 15,000 contacts from emails, to build a comprehensive data set.</li>
                            <li>Identified 1,500 contacts that had previously slipped through the cracks, creating new
                                business opportunities.</li>
                            <li>Added more than £2 million to their sales pipeline in the first 6 months after the
                                extraction.</li>
                            <li>Put Franken Group in a stronger position to maintain client relationships and act upon
                                new business opportunities.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrated how AI and technology can successfully transform business operations and
                                help to drive growth.</li>
